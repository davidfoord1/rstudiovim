## Configure RStudio Vim keybindings ‚å®Ô∏è

RStudio supports Vim keybindings in the source editor, but 
[doesn't support a Vim keybinding config](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/7350).
{rstudiovim} offers a ü™ü **Windows-only** workaround by reading Vim commands from 
a file and simulating key presses to execute them on your behalf.

#### Overview
You can install the package  from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidfoord1/rstudiovim")
```

Load the package with:

``` r
library(rstudiovim)
```

Create and edit a config file (.vimrc), adding a Vim command on each line:

``` r
file.edit(rsvim_default_file())
```

Execute all the commands in the config file:

```r
rsvim_exec_file()
```

We can use Vim commands `map`, `imap`, `nmap` and `vmap` in our file to 
customise our keybindings. These bindings persist for the duration of the 
RStudio session. Then by using `rsvim_exec_file()` in our 
[`.Rprofile`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/Startup) 
to execute R code at the start of every R session, we can ensure that these 
bindings are always active.

Alternatively execute individual commands with a string like:

```r
rsvim_exec("help")
```

## Example üîç

Here's a couple of things you might want configured:

1. Going from insert mode to normal mode with `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` might feel like
too much movement for a common action. It can be nice to have an option to do so
using home-row keys. You can achieve this with something like `:imap jk <Esc>`
from normal mode in the source editor.

2. When you yank text (e.g. `yiw`) and then select other text and paste over
it (e.g. `viwp`), the replaced text will be the next thing you paste. So you
might want to have a shortcut for pasting while keeping yanked text like `:map
\p pgvy`.

Again, these mappings only persist while you have RStudio open, so here are the
steps to have these settings apply every time you are editing in RStudio:

**Create a file containing the commands.** 

{rstudiovim} suggests a file path you can edit with:

```r
file.edit(rsvim_default_file())
```

Each command must be on its own line. Do not include the preceding `:`, just the
text you would enter in the command dialogue box, like:

```vim
imap jk <Esc>
map \p pgvy

```

**Execute config on R session start.** 

With the package installed, add the following to your `.Rprofile`:

```r
if (interactive) rstudiovim::rsvim_exec_file()
```

With this, whenever you are insert mode and type `jk` in one key chain, you will
return to normal mode.  you can select and paste over other text with e.g.
`viw\p` multiple times, pasting the originally yanked text.

### Config in the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

The exec file function points by default to the `rsvim_default_file()` path, 
but you can use any text file or connection object containing your Vim commands.
For instance you can use a web location to easily share the config between
machines, like this to execute the [example vimrc](https://github.com/davidfoord1/rstudiovim/blob/main/inst/example.vimrc):

```r
rsvim_exec_file("https://raw.github.com/davidfoord1/rstudiovim/main/inst/example.vimrc")
```

## Conditions for success. üìÉ

1. You're using RStudio on Windows.
2. Setting `Keybinding set for editor` must be Vim (of course!).
3. **A file must be open in the source editor**, so that you could execute Vim 
commands if you navigated to source yourself. Otherwise it will probably 
try Vim commands in the R console.
